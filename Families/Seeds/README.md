# STING Seed Families — Author's Manual-Finishing Guide

This folder hosts the polished `.rfa` files that live in the **corporate baseline**. The auto-generated drafts go to `<project>/_BIM_COORD/Families/Seeds/`; your hand-finished versions belong here and are never touched by the generator.

`BuildSeedFamiliesCommand` reads the 16 JSON specs in `StingTools/Data/Seeds/` and gives you:

| What the generator provides | What you still add manually |
|---|---|
| Correct `.rft` template for the Revit category | Readable 2D plan symbol at 1:50 / 1:100 |
| All shared parameters with stable GUIDs | Section / elevation symbology |
| Every `STING_*` / `ASS_*` / discipline parameter already bound | 3D geometry that reads as the right object class |
| Minimal 2D outline from the JSON `geometry` block | Connector face-anchoring and domain classification |
| 3D bounding box from `solid3D` | Named type variants matching the swap registry |
| MEP connectors at JSON-declared positions | Type parameter values per variant |
| `STING_SEED_FAMILY_TXT` stamped on every type | `Mark = PEN_CONTROL_NUMBER_TXT` formula where relevant |

## What's new — Phase add-type-variants

### 1. Rebuild mode picker

Every time you click **Build Seed Families** a three-option dialog now appears before any files are written:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Safe (missing only)** *(default)* | Only generates seeds that don't already have an `.rfa` on disk. Your polished files are never touched. |
| **Rebuild unfinalized** | Regenerates any `.rfa` that does NOT have a `.sting-finalized` sidecar alongside it. Files you've marked as finished are skipped. |
| **Rebuild all** | Overwrites every `.rfa`, including finalized ones. Requires a second confirmation dialog. Families with `"protectExisting": true` in their JSON are skipped even in this mode. |

The default is always **Safe (missing only)** — pressing Enter or clicking the first button never destroys polished work.

### 2. Finalization sidecar — marking a seed as finished

Once you are happy with a seed, create a small JSON sidecar file alongside the `.rfa`:

```
STING_SEED_ElectricalFixture.rfa          ← your polished family
STING_SEED_ElectricalFixture.sting-finalized  ← protection marker
```

**To create the sidecar in one step**, run this in the Revit API console or a PowerShell terminal from the Seeds folder:

```powershell
# PowerShell — run from the folder containing the .rfa
$rfa = "STING_SEED_ElectricalFixture.rfa"
@{ finalized = (Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ"); note = "Polished by <initials>" } |
  ConvertTo-Json | Set-Content ("$rfa" -replace "\.rfa$", ".sting-finalized")
```

Or, inside Revit, call `SymbolLibraryCreator.MarkFinalized(rfaPath, "Polished by BK 2026-05")` — the API method writes an identical JSON file.

**To remove the sidecar** (allow future regeneration):

```powershell
Remove-Item "STING_SEED_ElectricalFixture.sting-finalized"
```

The sidecar has no effect on Revit loading — it is only read by `BuildSeedFamiliesCommand`.

### 3. `protectExisting` flag in the JSON spec

Every seed JSON now has `"protectExisting": true`. This is a hard-coded guard in the spec itself: even if a developer runs **Rebuild all**, the generator refuses to overwrite an existing `.rfa` for that seed. It is the backstop for seeds that encode important company-standard geometry. To override it you must remove or set the flag to `false` in the JSON source.

### 4. Importing a pre-built manufacturer family as a seed

You can supply a finished `.rfa` (e.g., a downloaded Revit content file from a manufacturer) and have the generator **augment** it with STING parameters without touching its geometry:

```json
"sourceFamilyPath": "Families/Seeds/Source/Grundfos_MAGNA3.rfa"
```

When `sourceFamilyPath` is set, `BuildSeedFamiliesCommand`:

1. Opens the source `.rfa` in Family Editor (hidden)
2. Injects every shared parameter from the JSON spec idempotently (skips params that already exist by GUID)
3. Adds or updates type variants whose names match the JSON's `typeVariants` array
4. Saves the result to the output folder under the seed's standard filename

The source file is never modified — the output is a copy. Paths are resolved relative to the JSON spec's location, then relative to the project root, then as absolute paths.

**Use this when:** a manufacturer supplies Revit families that are already geometrically accurate and you want to avoid duplicating work. The swap registry for that seed will still point to the same manufacturer family — the seed IS the manufacturer family, pre-enriched with STING parameters.

### 5. Auto-registered swap candidates

Each JSON spec now contains a `swapCandidates` array. After every build run, `BuildSeedFamiliesCommand` merges those entries into `STING_FAMILY_SWAP_REGISTRY.json` (stored in `<project>/_BIM_COORD/`).

**How the merge works (Phase 179 update):**

- Every auto-registered candidate is tagged with `"source": "auto"` in the JSON.
- Your manually curated entries (no `source` field, or `"source": "manual"`) are **never touched**.
- On each rebuild, the merge performs a *prune pass* that removes stale `"source": "auto"` entries whose seed variant name no longer exists in the current JSON spec (e.g., you deleted a type variant). This keeps the registry from accumulating ghost candidates.
- New auto-candidates are appended; existing auto-candidates are updated in place.

In short: **manually curated entries survive forever; auto-entries mirror the current seed JSON exactly.**

```json
"swapCandidates": [
  {
    "label": "Waldner / Kewlab Fume Hood",
    "familyPath": "",          // empty = user browses at swap time
    "variantPattern": "FUME_HOOD*",   // regex matched against the loaded family's types
    "priority": 1,
    "autoLoad": false          // true = attempt to load from familyPath automatically
  }
]
```

To pre-populate a `familyPath`, set it to a path relative to the project's Families folder or an absolute network path. Setting `autoLoad: true` and a valid path lets **Swap to Manufacturer** run silently in batch mode without a file-picker dialog.

## What's new — Phase 179

Six generator improvements that reduce the amount of manual work after each build run.

### 1. Subcategory auto-applied

The generator now creates and assigns the `STING_SEED` subcategory automatically. You no longer need to create it by hand in Family Editor. The subcategory is applied to every solid and 2D line element that the JSON geometry block creates. If you add new geometry manually after the build, assign it to `STING_SEED` yourself (Manage → Object Styles → Sub-objects).

### 2. Line and arc styles applied at build time

Previously the generator created 2D geometry with the default "Medium Lines" style. The JSON `geometry` block now accepts a `lineStyle` field. Built-in legal values are `"Thin Lines"`, `"Medium Lines"`, `"Wide Lines"`, `"<Overhead>"`, and any project-specific line style by exact name. All penetration seeds default to `"Medium Lines"` in their JSON.

### 3. `IsShared` correctly honoured

Earlier builds silently ignored the `"isShared": true` flag in the JSON parameter definitions, creating project-only parameters instead of shared ones. This is now fixed — every parameter marked `isShared: true` is created as a shared parameter bound through the STING shared parameter file. If you see a parameter listed without a GUID in *Family Types* → *Manage* → *Shared Parameters*, it was created before this fix; delete it from the family and rebuild.

### 4. Domain and system-type validation

The generator validates each connector's `domain` and `systemType` combination against Revit's legal matrix before writing the connector. If an illegal combination is detected (e.g., `domain: HVAC` + `systemType: Domestic Cold Water`), a warning appears in the build result dialog and the connector is left with a `None` system type rather than crashing the build.

### 5. Formula syntax checking

The `formulaBindings` array in each JSON spec (used to document formulas you must enter manually in Family Editor) is now syntax-checked at build time. If the formula uses a parameter name that is not in the seed's own `parameters` array, a warning is emitted. This catches typos in the JSON spec early — for example, if the formula references `PEN_CONTROL_NUMBER_TXT` but the seed doesn't declare that parameter, you'll see the warning before spending time in Family Editor.

### 6. Rebuild result dialog improvements

The result dialog now shows three totals: **Created**, **Skipped (finalized / protected)**, **Warnings**. The "Skipped" count replaces the old silent pass-through — you can see immediately how many seeds were protected rather than having to check the log.

---

## Standard per-seed workflow

1. **Run Build Seed Families** — choose *Safe (missing only)* unless you need to regenerate.
2. **Open** the resulting `.rfa` in Family Editor — right-click the family in Project Browser → *Edit Family*.
3. **Verify parameters** — open *Family Types* (Manage tab). Every parameter below should be present. If any are missing, run `LoadSharedParamsCommand` first and retry.
4. **Polish 2D** — follow the per-seed symbol guidance below.
5. **Polish 3D** — replace the bounding box with object-class-appropriate geometry.
6. **Wire connectors** — drag each connector onto the correct face reference plane; set domain and system classification.
7. **Create type variants** — Family Types → *Duplicate* for each variant; set parameters per the tables below.
8. **Save and reload** — *File → Save*; when prompted *Load into Project and Close*, click yes.
9. **Mark as finalized** — create the `.sting-finalized` sidecar (see §2 above).
10. **Copy polished `.rfa` here** — `Families/Seeds/` is the corporate baseline. The project-scoped copy under `_BIM_COORD/` is the runtime fallback.
11. **Test end-to-end** — place, tag, schedule, swap. See the [End-to-end test](#after-authoring-end-to-end-test) section.

## Common subcategory pattern

In Family Editor: Manage → Object Styles → Sub-objects → New subcategory named **STING_SEED**.

Recommended line weights:

| View | Weight |
|---|---|
| Plan / Section (projection) | 3 |
| Primary symbol elements | 4 |
| Cut | 5 |

One VG override line in every view template then controls all seed families simultaneously. In your project's view templates, add a subcategory override for `Specialty Equipment : STING_SEED` → Projection colour = RGB(0, 128, 192), Cut colour = RGB(0, 0, 0).

---

## STING_SEED_LightingFixture

**Hosting:** Ceiling-based · **Template:** `Metric Lighting Fixture ceiling based.rft` · **Symbol size at 1:100:** 6 mm  
**15 type variants**

### 2D plan symbol
- 600×600 mm rectangle (auto-generated outline). Relocate to family origin if needed.
- Diagonal `X` corner-to-corner — auto-generated.

- Material: a generic `STING_LumPlate` material (white). Manufacturer swap replaces this.

### Type variants — set these parameters in *Family Types*

| Type name | `ASS_PRODCT_COD_TXT` | `LTG_DIMMABLE_BOOL` | `LTG_IP_RATING_TXT` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RECESSED_LED_600x600` | `LTG-R` | `1` | `IP20` | Default |

### Connector note
Lighting fixtures do not require MEP connectors in the STING scheme — electrical circuit topology is managed via `ELC_CIRCUIT_GROUP_TXT` parameter, not connector topology. Leave connectors as-is (none declared in the JSON).

---

## STING_SEED_ElectricalFixture

**Hosting:** Face-based · **Template:** `Metric Electrical Fixture face based.rft` · **Symbol size at 1:100:** 4 mm  
**26 type variants — full gang/way combinatorial matrix**

### Gang and way — what they mean

**Gang** = the number of switch or socket modules on a single back-plate (1, 2, 3, or 4).  
**Way** = the switching circuit topology:

| Way code | Meaning | Where used |
|---|---|---|
| `1W` | 1-way (single location) | Most lighting circuits |
| `2W` | 2-way (two-location switching) | Corridors, staircases |
| `INT` | Intermediate (three or more locations) | Long corridors — fitted between two 2-way switches |
| `DIM` | Dimmer | Living / hospitality spaces, DALI rooms |
| `DP` | Double-pole switch (isolator) | Shower, immersion heater, kitchen |

### 2D plan symbol guidance

- **Sockets:** Rectangle (plate outline) + short vertical strokes inside for each socket. 1G = 1 stroke, 2G = 2 strokes, etc.
- **Switches:** Rectangle + horizontal slits (one per gang). Add a diagonal line for 2-way, double diagonal for intermediate.
- **Data outlets:** Rectangle + small `J45` or `D` label inside.
- **Floor box:** Square 200×200 mm, centred on origin.
- All mounting-height labels: add an annotation label referencing `ELE_FIX_MOUNT_HEIGHT_MM` to the front elevation view so the symbol self-reports height on elevations and sections.

### 3D representation
- Standard wall plate: 150×35×85 mm for 2G, 75×35×85 mm for 1G, 200×35×85 mm for 3G/4G.
- Projecting 5 mm proud of the face plane.
- Floor box: 200×200×80 mm, flush with floor.

### How `ELE_FIX_GANG_COUNT_INT` is used downstream
This integer parameter feeds quantity take-off schedules — a 2G socket counts as 2 gangs for materials budgets. Do not leave it at zero; set it to the integer matching the gang count for every type.

### Connector wiring (critical)
The JSON declares top + bottom connectors at z = ±0.5 of the bounding box. In Family Editor after resizing the 3D solid:

1. Select each connector (in 3D view, use Tab to cycle to the small connector symbol).
2. Drag onto the correct face reference plane — top face for supply-in, bottom face for distribution-out.
3. Set **Domain** = Electrical. Set **System** = Power (supply-in) / Power - Balanced (distribution-out, 3-phase balanced load) / Power - Unbalanced (1-phase).
4. For MSB / MCC: set supply connector at the bottom (cable entry from below), distribution connectors at top of each section.

**10 type variants** — auto-placed by conduit-run engine at every break exceeding BS 7671 §522.8.5 limit (3 bends per segment)

### 2D plan symbol
- Auto-generated square + cross + horizontal centre line reads as a tee junction box. Keep.

### 3D representation
- Standard box: 100×100×60 mm. This is already correct in the auto-generated solid.
- Vary width and depth per type; keep height constant at 60–100 mm.

### Connectors (auto-generated electrical connectors — verify facing)
Four electrical connectors at ±X and ±Y faces. In Family Editor, confirm each connector:
- Domain = Electrical
- System = Conduit (or Cable Tray for busbar types)
- Connectors are non-connectable stubs — they signal topological presence to `AutoConduitDrop`, not physical pipe connectivity.

### How `ELC_JB_AUTO_PLACED_BOOL` works
When the conduit-routing engine auto-inserts a junction box, it sets this parameter to `1` and writes the upstream/downstream element IDs into `ELC_JB_UPSTREAM_REF_TXT` and `ELC_JB_DOWNSTREAM_REF_TXT`. Boxes placed manually have it set to `0`. This distinction drives the *Auto-Placed JBs* schedule view — useful for reviewing generated topologies before issuing schematics.

- Auto-generated rectangle + 4 small circles (one per gas service) reads as a multi-service bedhead unit. Keep for `BEDHEAD_UNIT_WARD`.
- For single-service terminal units: use a rectangle + 1 circle offset left.
- For AVSU box: rectangle with a bold border and diagonal stripe.

### Gas-specific colour coding (apply via Subcategory overrides in view templates)
HTM 02-01 colour code: O₂ = white, N₂O = blue, Medical Air = black+white, VAC = yellow, CO₂ = grey, N₂ = black.
Add a subcategory per gas and assign the colour — this lets engineers rapidly audit gas coverage in views.

### 3D representation
- Terminal unit: 400×80×200 mm flat wall panel.
- AVSU box: 500×200×400 mm surface-mounted box.
- Bedhead unit: 1200×80×350 mm long panel.

### Connectors (auto-generated)
Three inlet connectors (8 mm) + one outlet/vacuum connector (12 mm). In Family Editor:
- Set each inlet: Domain = Piping, System = Other Pipe, Direction = In, Size = 8 mm
- Set the outlet (VAC or drain): Domain = Piping, System = Other Pipe, Direction = Out, Size = 12 mm

### HTM 02-01 compliance note
`MGS_AVSU_ZONE_TXT` must be completed for all AVSU and alarm panel instances — the MGPS validation command uses it to confirm every zone has exactly one AVSU per gas and that all TUs on a zone are downstream of that AVSU. Leave the parameter blank in the family type; it is set per instance at placement time.

### ANSI Z358.1 compliance note
`LAB_FIX_DELUGE_LMIN` drives the emergency fixture sizing report. The values in the table (6 / 76 / 82 / 11 L/min) are ANSI Z358.1 minimums — do not reduce them. The plumbing engineer must confirm the supply pressure delivers these flow rates at the fixture.

## STING_SEED_SpecialityEquipment — FRP Penetrations

**Hosting:** Face-based · **Template:** `Metric Specialty Equipment face based.rft` · **Symbol size at 1:100:** 5 mm  
**11 type variants** — fire-rated and unrated MEP penetration seals

> **This is the highest-priority seed to polish.** Every duct, pipe, cable, and cable-tray crossing a fire-rated element gets one of these. The Penetration Register is auto-generated from instances of this seed — the `PEN_CONTROL_NUMBER_TXT` field is the register's primary key.

> **Full workflow guide:** [`docs/PENETRATION_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`](../../docs/PENETRATION_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) explains the complete 8-step process for non-BIM users — from detection and placement through to the A1 register sheet and COBie CSV export.

### 2D plan symbol
- Concentric circles (Ø500 outer, Ø350 inner — auto-generated) with four short tick lines crossing the gap at 0°/90°/180°/270°. Reads as a sleeve-through.
- For section view (Front elevation): add a 200 mm vertical bar with horizontal arrows pointing in/out (auto-generated from the JSON `section` block).
- Subcategory: `STING_SEED`.

### Critical formula — wire Mark to control number
In Family Editor, open *Family Types*, select the formula cell next to **Mark**, type:
```
= PEN_CONTROL_NUMBER_TXT
```
This makes the control number visible in tag schedules without extra wiring. The `formulaBindings` block in the JSON documents this requirement — **it is not auto-applied**; you must add it manually.

### 3D representation
Replace the auto box with a conical sleeve: 80×80 mm at top narrowing to 60×60 mm at bottom, 200 mm tall. Add a 2D line at the soffit reference plane for section view visibility.

## STING_SEED_FireDamper

**Hosting:** Face-based · **Template:** `Metric Specialty Equipment face based.rft` · **Symbol size at 1:100:** 6 mm  
**13 type variants** — BS EN 15650 / EN 1366-2 fire and combined fire/smoke dampers

> **Full workflow guide:** [`docs/PENETRATION_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`](../../docs/PENETRATION_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)

### 2D plan symbol
- Auto-generated square with cross diagonals and centre cross reads as a fire damper. Keep.
- Add a small filled half-moon arc at one side for actuator position on motorised types.

### 3D representation
- Rectangular dampers: 400×200×400 mm box (W×D×H where D = duct depth). This scales with the installed duct size — parameterise width and height against instance parameters.
- Round dampers: Ø250 mm cylinder, 200 mm long.

### Critical formula
```
Mark = PEN_CONTROL_NUMBER_TXT
```
Same as SpecialityEquipment — the fire damper register uses this as its key.

### Type variants

| Type name | `ASS_PRODCT_COD_TXT` | `PEN_FIRE_RATING_TXT` | `FD_BSEN15650_CLASS_TXT` | `FD_ACTUATION_TXT` | Notes |

| `FD_CURTAIN_FR60` | `FD-C` | `FR60` | `EI60` | `GRAVITY_FUSIBLE_LINK` | Restricted depth |

### BS EN 15650 class notation
- `EI60S` = 60-minute integrity + insulation, self-closing (S = spring/gravity close — no power needed)
- `EIS60` = Fire + Smoke combined, 60-minute
- `ES` = Smoke only, no fire integrity
- Suffix `300` (e.g., `EI60S300`) indicates leakage class — add when specified by the acoustic engineer.

### Known gap — `FD_CURTAIN_FR60`

The `FD_CURTAIN_FR60` type variant is present in the seed family and the drawing register table above, but `PenetrationProductSelector.MapDamperVariant` **cannot currently place it automatically**. Curtain fire dampers are only suitable where the host wall or floor has insufficient depth for a blade damper (typically < 75 mm), and that depth check requires a host-element parameter (`STING_WALL_DEPTH_MM` or similar) that is not yet exposed to the selector engine.

**Until the selector is updated:**
- Curtain dampers must be placed manually.
- After placement, set `PEN_TYPE_VARIANT_TXT = FD_CURTAIN_FR60` on the instance by hand so the register and coverage audit treat it correctly.
- The auto-tagger and register schedule work correctly on manually placed curtain dampers.

**To enable automatic curtain-damper selection** (future work): add `STING_WALL_DEPTH_MM` as a calculated parameter on Wall types and plumb it into `PenetrationProductSelector.MapDamperVariant` via a depth-restriction check before the standard blade-damper variants.

## After authoring: end-to-end test

1. Place one instance of each polished seed in a test plan view.
2. **Tag each** — existing STING tag families pick them up automatically (they bind by category + shared param GUID, not family name).
3. **Schedule** — open a schedule for the relevant category. Every parameter in the JSON spec's `parameters` array must appear as a schedulable field. If a parameter is missing from the schedule fields, it was not bound — run `LoadSharedParamsCommand` and reload the family.
4. **Swap to Manufacturer** — load a real manufacturer family, then run the swap command on a test instance:
   - Position / rotation / host must be preserved exactly.
   - Tag must still read (parameters survive via GUID, not name).
   - `STING_DESIGN_REF_TXT` now contains the original seed ID.
   - `STING_SWAP_HISTORY_TXT` records timestamp + operator + source/dest pair.
5. **Double-swap** — select the already-swapped instance and swap again to a different manufacturer family. Both swap history entries must appear in `STING_SWAP_HISTORY_TXT`.
6. **Rebuild-safe test** — re-run `BuildSeedFamiliesCommand` in *Safe (missing only)* mode. Confirm zero polished families were overwritten (check `Result: X protected` in the command result dialog).
7. **Finalization test** — create a `.sting-finalized` sidecar for one seed. Re-run in *Rebuild unfinalized* mode. Confirm that finalized seed was skipped and the others were regenerated.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: I re-ran Build Seed Families and my polished family was overwritten.**  
A: You were in *Rebuild all* mode and the JSON doesn't have `"protectExisting": true`. Fix: add `"protectExisting": true` to the seed's JSON spec, OR create the `.sting-finalized` sidecar before the next run, OR always use *Safe (missing only)* mode. Store polished `.rfa` files in `Families/Seeds/` (this corporate folder) — the command only writes to `<project>/_BIM_COORD/Families/Seeds/`.

**Q: How do I force a full regeneration of one specific seed after updating its JSON?**  
A: Delete (or temporarily rename) the `.sting-finalized` sidecar for that seed, then run *Rebuild unfinalized*. Only that seed regenerates; all finalized seeds are skipped.

**Q: A type variant is missing from the swap candidates list.**  
A: The swap picker matches `variantPattern` (a regex) against the loaded family's type names. If no match fires, edit `STING_FAMILY_SWAP_REGISTRY.json` at `<project>/_BIM_COORD/` and add a pattern that matches the manufacturer family's type name. Project overrides are additive — they merge on top of the auto-registered candidates from the seed JSON.

**Q: Connectors disappeared after the swap.**  
A: Revit re-creates connectors from the destination family's definitions. Unmatched connectors are dropped. Run `AutoJoinMepConnectors` on the swapped set; for unrecoverable electrical topology, run `BatchAssignCircuits`.

**Q: Shared parameters are missing from the Family Types dialog.**  
A: The shared parameter file was not loaded before building. Run `LoadSharedParamsCommand` (dock panel → *Load Params*), then re-run `BuildSeedFamiliesCommand` in *Rebuild unfinalized* or *Rebuild all* mode for the affected seeds.

**Q: I have a manufacturer `.rfa` I want to use as the seed geometry.**  
A: Set `"sourceFamilyPath"` in the seed's JSON to the relative path of the manufacturer `.rfa` (e.g., `"Families/Seeds/Source/Grundfos_MAGNA3.rfa"`). On the next build run, the command opens that file, injects STING parameters idempotently, and saves the result under the seed's standard filename. Your source `.rfa` is never modified.

**Q: My company needs a seed category that isn't in the list.**  
A: Drop a new `STING_SEED_<Category>.json` into `StingTools/Data/Seeds/` following the same schema as existing specs. Run `Build Seed Families` — no code change is required. The new seed appears in the swap registry automatically after the first build.

**Q: The penetration register is empty even though I've placed SpecialityEquipment instances.**  
A: The `PEN_CONTROL_NUMBER_TXT` parameter must be non-empty for a penetration to appear in the register. Either enter numbers manually, or run `PenetrationAutoNumberCommand` which assigns sequential control numbers per host-element. Also confirm the `Mark = PEN_CONTROL_NUMBER_TXT` formula was added in Family Editor (it is not auto-applied).
